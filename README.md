# aer-calendar

Aer Calendar is a JavaScript library that allows for easy generation of calendars using a constructor.

# How to Use
You can pass arguments into the constructor four ways:
<pre>
new Calendar(id)
new Calendar(id, month) // defaults to current
new Calendar(id, month, year)
new Calendar({
  id: required,
  month: optional, // defaults to current
  year: optional   // defaults to current
})
</pre>

# CSS classing
All calendars generated by this plugin are classed with "aer-calendar" - <code>&lt;table class=&quot;aer-calendar&quot;&gt;</code>. No styles are applied out of the box, but users can use this as a hook to style however they want.

# Future Additions
The following are features that are planned to be added soon:

- Animations on month change
- Google Calendar API support for easy integration
- **Maybe** classes for cells to differentiate between them
