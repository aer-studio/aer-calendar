# aer-calendar

Aer Calendar is a JavaScript library that allows for easy generation of calendars using a constructor.

# How to Use
To use the Aer Calendar library, you must first provide an element with an ID, for example:
<pre>&lt;div id=&#39;calendar&#39;&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</pre>
Then, make a new Calendar object and generate the calendar:
<pre>
var calendar = new Calendar('calendar', 2015, 2);
calendar.generate();
</pre>

# CSS classing
All calendars generated by this plugin are classed with "aer-calendar" - <code>&lt;table class=&quot;aer-calendar&quot;&gt;</code>. No styles are applied out of the box, but users can use this as a hook to style however they want.

# Future Additions
The following are features that are planned to be added soon:

- Animations on month change
- Google Calendar API support for easy integration
- **Maybe** classes for cells to differentiate between them
