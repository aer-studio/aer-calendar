# aer-calendar
**Please note that this is very early in development!**

A JavaScript plugin that extends both the DOM and jQuery and provides a method to generate a calendar using pure JavaScript.

# How to Use
There are three ways to use the aer-calendar plugin. If you have jQuery loaded, you can use either use a custom HTML element (will result in invalid HTML):
<pre>&#60;calendar year="2015" month="2"&#62;&#60;/calendar&#62;</pre>
or use standard jQuery selectors (recommended) with the '.generateCalendar(<year>, <month>)' method. For example:
<pre>&lt;div id=&quot;calendar&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<pre>$("calendar").generateCalendar(year, month);</pre>
You can also use pure JavaScript to generate a calendar using document object selectors:
<pre>&lt;div id=&quot;calendar&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<pre>document.getElementById('calendar').innerHTML = calendar.generate(year, month);</pre>

# CSS classing
All calendars generated by this plugin are classed with "aer-calendar" - <code>&lt;table class=&quot;aer-calendar&quot;&gt;</code>. No styles are applied out of the box, but users can use this as a hook to style however they want.

# Future Additions
The following are features that are planned to be added soon:

- Generated month changing buttons with handlers
- Animations on month change
- **Maybe** add Calendar helper functions to allow for getting calendar information
- **Maybe** classes for cells to differentiate between them
- Google Calendar API support for easy integration
